# LLM Model Evaluation and Fine-Tuning

## Project Description

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for model evaluation and fine-tuning tasks. The notebooks are designed to help data scientists and machine learning practitioners evaluate and fine-tune their machine learning models using various techniques.

## Contents

- `Model_Evaluation_UdacityGenAIAWS.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on evaluating machine learning models. It includes methods for assessing model performance, visualizing metrics, and interpreting results.
- `Model_FineTuning.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates the process of fine-tuning machine learning models to improve their performance. It covers hyperparameter tuning, model optimization, and validation techniques.

## Installation

To run the notebooks, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Common Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```
## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivam-nath-10003/model-evaluation-finetuning.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd model-evaluation-finetuning
```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
or
```bash
jupyter lab
```
4. Open the desired notebook:
 - `Model_Evaluation_UdacityGenAIAWS.ipynb`
 - `Model_FineTuning.ipynb`
5. Run the cells in the notebooks to execute the code.
